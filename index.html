          <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.<br>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.<br>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr><br>
                <caption>Python Data Types</caption>

          <header>Data Storage</header>
          <p>There are 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, these 4 are List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</p>
          <p><br><em><strong>List</strong></em></p>
          <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
          <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            print(thislist)</code>
          <p><em><strong>Tuple</strong></em></p>
          <p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
            Tuples are written with round brackets:</p>
          <code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
            print(thistuple)</code>
          <p><em><strong>Set</strong></em></p>
          <p>Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.<br>* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. <br>Sets are written with curly brackets:</p>
          <code>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
            print(thisset)</code>
          <p><em><strong>Dictionary</strong></em></p>
          <p>Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
            A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
            Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:</p>
          <code>thisdict = {
            &nbsp; "brand": "Ford",
            &nbsp; "model": "Mustang",
            &nbsp; "year": 1964
            }
            print(thisdict)</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="condition_&_loops">
          <header>Condition & Loops</header>
          <p><br><em><strong>Conditions and If statements</strong></em></p>
          <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
          <article>Equals: a == b
            Not Equals: a != b
            Less than: a < b
            Less than or equal to: a <= b
            Greater than: a > b
            Greater than or equal to: a >= b
          </article>
          <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
            An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword:</p>
          <code>a = 33
            b = 200
            if b > a:
            &nbsp; print("b is greater than a")</code>
          <p><em><strong>The while Loop</strong></em></p>
          <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
          <p>Print i as long as i is less than 6:</p>
          <code>i = 1
            while i < 6:
            &nbsp; print(i)
            &nbsp; i += 1</code>
          <p><em><strong>For Loops</strong></em></p>
          <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
            This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
            With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
          <p>Print each fruit in a fruit list:</p>
          <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            for x in fruits:
            &nbsp; print(x)</code>
          </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
          <header>Functions</header>
          <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
            A function can return data as a result.</p>
          <p><br><em><strong>Creating a Function</strong></em></p>
          <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
          <code>def my_function():
            &nbsp; print("Hello from a function")</code>
          <p><br><em><strong>Calling a Function</strong></em></p>
          <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
          <code>def my_function():
            &nbsp; print("Hello from a function")
            my_function()</code>
